# discord-tone-indicators

A Discord bot for identifying tone indicators used in comments on a Discord guild. To use, clone the repository. Define DISCORD_TOKEN in .envvars ('DISCORD_TOKEN={put token here}'), and run bot.py. On Discord, the bot should attempt to find tone indicators in any message which is reacted to with the "‚ùî" emoji (thats :&#8203;grey_question:).
